Hey there, this is the code of my personal blog, built with [Travis Fischer](https://transitivebullsh.it).

If you don't know, it's an incredible starter kit for building websites with Next.js and Notion.

If you are instead interested in my content, go to [debonx.com](https://debonx.com), I'll try to post there whatever I have in mind, when possible.

Thanks for stopping by,
Emanuele
